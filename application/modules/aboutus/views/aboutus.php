                                <p>While doing research to obtain the facts and details of those eminent personalities gradually we have developed a zeal of serving the own community in different aspects. Some of the well-wishers have suggested a noble path of establishing the Kamma Communal matrimonial services.</p>
								<p>As we do have the good and prospective contacts with Kamma community people and all most all the Kamma Sanghams in the states of Telangana, Andhrapradesh, Tamilnadu, Maharastra, Karnataka and Abroad, we have seriously thought about establishing a Kamma matrimonial service portal.</p>
								<p>Primarily based on the research methodology and out of curiosity and enthusiasm We have started off line Matrimonial services exclusively for the Known, kith and kin Kamma community people. Within no time we have received a great response and appreciations for the whole hearted services given by us.</p>
